# self-numbers-generator
To find a sum of self-numbers between two positive integers

FuncD(n) is n plus the sum of the digit of n
For example: 
FuncD(75) = 75 + 7 + 5 = 87

FuncD(91) = 91 + 9 + 1 = 101
FuncD(100) = 100 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 101

Since 101 can be generated from FuncD(91) and FuncD(100), therefore 101 is not a self-number

A number with no generators is a self-number.
